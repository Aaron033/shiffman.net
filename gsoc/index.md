2014 marks [The Processing Foundation](http://processing.org)'s fourth year participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/).  Following is a summary of the eleven projects, in alphabetical order by project name, completed this summer by a terrific group of students.

N) [Loom](http://chrisjr.github.io/loom) by [Chris Johnson-Roberson](http://www.chrisjr.org/), mentored by R. Luke DuBois. Loom lets you create and manipulate patterns of timed events. These patterns can be mapped to audiovisual output, transformed in various ways, and recorded to enable non-realtime synthesis and synchronized video. ([Source code](http://github.com/chrisjr/loom).)

N) **[PDE X for Processing 3.0](http://www.mkmoharana.com/2014/08/google-summer-of-code-2014-its-wrap.html)** by [Manindra Moharana](http://www.mkmoharana.com/), mentored by [Daniel Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/) - [PDE X](http://www.mkmoharana.com/2013/09/announcing-pde-x.html) is a Processing mode that introduces advanced IDE features like code completion, refactoring, live error checking, debugger and more. The goal of the project was to bring PDE X to a stable state and make it the default editor for Processing 3.0. The main focus was on fixing the last remaining bugs and tweaking/refining what was already present. A few new features were also introduced. Please see [Manindra's post](http://www.mkmoharana.com/2014/08/google-summer-of-code-2014-its-wrap.html) for more details on what was accomplished.
