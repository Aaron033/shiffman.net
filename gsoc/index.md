N) [Loom](http://chrisjr.github.io/loom) by [Chris Johnson-Roberson](http://www.chrisjr.org/), mentored by R. Luke DuBois. Loom lets you create and manipulate patterns of timed events. These patterns can be mapped to audiovisual output, transformed in various ways, and recorded to enable non-realtime synthesis and synchronized video.
