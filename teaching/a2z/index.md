I originally taught this course (2007-2008) in Java.  The [old notes can be found here](http://shiffman.net/teaching/a2z_2008/).  I'm now teaching a new version of this course using JavaScript and using [p5.js](http://p5js.org).  Here is [the current syllabus](https://github.com/shiffman/Programming-from-A-to-Z-F14) (2014).  The notes are below.

## [The beginning](week1)
* Beyond Processing and into JavaScript and p5.js
* JavaScript 101
* Strings in JavaScript
* File I/0
* Simple Analysis
